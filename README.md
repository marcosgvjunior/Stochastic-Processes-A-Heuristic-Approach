# Stochastic Processes - A Heuristic Approach

This repository contains a notebook that presents a heuristic approach to stochasticity, focusing on systems biology. The code starts with a heuristic introduction, the notebook progresses through discrete applications of the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA), moves to continuous approaches with Langevin dynamics, and then examines distribution dynamics via the Fokker-Planck equation. Finally, it showcases examples of stochasticity in dynamics exhibiting limit cycles.

## Description

The notebook covers the following topics:

1. **Random walk**: Heuristic introduction of random walk for a systems biology class.
2. **SSA**: Simplified implementation of the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA), also known as Gillespie's algorithm.
3. **Langevin**: Implementating the Langevin equation for continuous stochastic processes.
4. **Fokker-Planck**: Solving the Fokker-Planck equation to study distribution dynamics.
8. **Limit cycles and bifurcations**:
   - **van_der_pol**: Analysis of the Van der Pol oscillator.
   - **fitzhugh_nagumo**: Exploration of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model.
   - **hopf_bifurcation**: Study of the Hopf bifurcation.
